### Introduction
One of my favorite childhood game is Head-On, a gravity shooter.
I've played weeks with this with my friends back in the days and had a lot of fun.
Since I was a game developer thought it would be good to create a similar game on the nowadays hardware.
As my other hobby is executable reverse-engineering I've found out how the game data is packed.
This tool is able to read sound bear files and convert them to raw waveform.

I've started to create such a game (for my internal use only) but because lack of time discontinued... at least the converter is here :)

### Build the app
One need Visual Studio 2019 (year it's quite old).
